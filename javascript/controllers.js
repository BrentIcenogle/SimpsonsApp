       { "name": "", "phrase": "America's favorite yellow family.", "picture": "image0.jpg", "info": "The Simpsons are a typical family who live in a fictional 'Middle American' town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in 'I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot'. Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons do not physically age and still appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another." },
       { "name": "Homer Simpson", "phrase": "D'oh!", "picture": "image1.jpg", "info": "The comic efficacy of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of stupidity and laziness, and his explosive anger. He has a low intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as 'creatively brilliant in his stupidity'. Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and 'is devoted to his stomach'. His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to 'change ... his mind when things go badly'. Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode 'Duffless' (season four, 1993) as a full-blown alcoholic." },
       { "name": "Marge Simpson", "phrase": "Hmmm...", "picture": "image2.jpg", "info": "Marge is generally a stereotypical sitcom mother, and she also plays the 'long-suffering wife' who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband. While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in 'Homer Alone' (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a mental breakdown. After spending time at 'Rancho Relaxo', during which her family barely coped with her absence, she returned refreshed and everyone promised to help out more often. Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she 'puts up with a lot in their marriage,' and has left Homer or thrown him out of the house on several occasions." },
       { "name": "Bart Simpson", "phrase": "Eat my shorts!", "picture": "image3.jpg", "info": "Bart's rebellious attitude has made him a disruptive student at Springfield Elementary School, where Bart is an underachiever and proud of it. He is constantly at odds with his teacher Ms. Krabappel, Principal Skinner, and occasionally Groundskeeper Willie. Bart does poorly in school and is well aware of it, having once declared, 'I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I'm happy about it?' On one occasion, Lisa successfully proves that Bart is dumber than a hamster." },
       { "name": "Lisa Simpson", "phrase": "If anyone wants me, I'll be in my room.", "picture": "image4.jpg", "info": "Lisa is highly intelligent and sees herself as a misfit within the Simpson family due to her knowledge. She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield, including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways. Lisa's knowledge covers a wide range of subjects, from astronomy to medicine, and she is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield. Although her rebellion against social norms is usually depicted as constructive and heroic, Lisa can be self-righteous at times." },
       { "name": "Maggie Simpson", "phrase": "(Pacifier Suck)", "picture": "image5.jpg", "info": "Maggie has performed a number of feats that suggest she is a baby genius. She has spelled out E=MC² with her baby blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center, and written her name on an Etch A Sketch. Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy. Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable marksman, as seen in 'Who Shot Mr. Burns?' where she shoots Mr. Burns with a handgun that falls into her hands, and in a more intentional manner during 'Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge' where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib." },
       { "name": "Abe Simpson", "phrase": "So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time.", "picture": "image6.jpg", "info": "Grampa Simpson is the father to Homer Simpson, father-in-law to Marge Simpson and grandfather to siblings Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Grampa has also fathered two illegitimate children; a daughter named Abbie by a British woman named Edwina while in the United Kingdom during World War II, and Herbert Powell by a carnival prostitute. Grampa has an older brother named Cyrus, who lives in Tahiti and has multiple native wives. He also has a younger brother named Chet, who owns an unsuccessful shrimp company. Grampa was briefly married to Amber, the same woman Homer married on a drinking binge in Las Vegas. Grampa has also been briefly married to Marge's sister, Selma Bouvier, though Homer was against it, and was once romantically linked to Marge's mother, Jacqueline Bouvier. Abe Simpson is currently married to Rita LaFleur." },
       { "name": "Ned Flanders", "phrase": "Hi-Diddly-Ho!", "picture": "image7.jpg", "info": "Ned Flanders, whose real first name is Nedward, is a genuinely well-meaning good-natured person and is one of the few in Springfield to whom that description applies. Firmly religious, he can be timid and something of a pushover. He is a Republican and a devout Evangelical Christian who strictly follows the Bible literally and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma. This has led to his frequent calls to Reverend Lovejoy, who has become increasingly frustrated with and uninterested in Flanders." },
       { "name": "Comic Book Guy", "phrase": "Worst website ever!", "picture": "image8.jpg", "info": "Comic Book Guy (claiming Jeff Albertson to be his real name in the episode 'Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass') is a morbidly obese, nerdy and snobby man best known for his eloquence and sarcastic quips. He is obsessed with collecting comic books and is an avid science fiction buff. He holds a master's degree in folklore and mythology (having translated The Lord of the Rings into Klingon as part of his thesis), as well as a degree in chemical engineering, has an IQ of 170, and is a member of the Springfield branch of Mensa. He has long hair, which he always keeps tied in a ponytail. His catchphrase is the declaration 'worst/best [subject] ever', sometimes to the point of breaking the fourth wall." },
       { "name": "Barney Gumble", "phrase": "Braap!", "picture": "image9.jpg", "info": "Barney was born on April 20 (which Homer remembers as being on the same day as Hitler's in 'Viva Ned Flanders' and Barney's entry into the Springfield Film Festival in 'A Star Is Burns' where Barney states that he is 40 years old). In the episode '$pringfield', he claims that he studied dance for several years, including modern and tap. Two episodes give different reasons for his alcoholism. 'Mr. Plow' suggests that Barney was a dedicated student looking forward to a bright future. He had his mind set on going to Harvard University, until Homer introduced him to beer the day before the SATs. Season 16's 'She Used to Be My Girl' attributes his drinking to his high school girlfriend Chloe Talbot leaving Springfield to pursue a journalism career." },
       { "name": "Frank Grimes", "phrase": "I'm better than okay. I'm Homer Simpson", "picture": "image10.jpg", "info": "Franklin 'Frank' Grimes, Sr. was an employee of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and the self-declared enemy of Homer Simpson. Frank Grimes was a hard worker, who had to earn everything the hard way. He was also irritable, grumpy, and easily annoyed, which means he may have had anger problems." },
       { "name": "Krusty the Clown", "phrase": "Hey, Hey, Kids!", "picture": "image11.jpg", "info": "Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky, formerly known as Rory B. Bellows, better known by his stage name Krusty the Clown or simply Krusty, is the cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoking clown host of Bart, Lisa's and Maggie's favorite TV show The Krusty the Clown Show." },
       { "name": "Duff Man", "phrase": "Oh, Yeah!", "picture": "image12.jpg", "info": "Barry Duffman, known mostly by his working name Duffman, is the mascot and spokesman for the Duff Beer company. There are actually multiple people who play Duffman. Duffman is generally known for his overly enthusiastic speech in which he refers to himself in the third person, complete with dramatic pauses and ending with a suggestive 'Oh, yeah!' and pelvic thrusts. Fittingly, his theme song which plays at every corporate-sponsored appearance is 'Oh Yeah' by Swiss band Yello. Also, Lenny calls him 'the guy who creates an awareness of Duff'." },
       { "name": "Nelson Muntz", "phrase": "Haw Haw!", "picture": "image13.jpg", "info": "Nelson Mandela Muntz is the main bully, and one of the true main antagonists of the series. He is the leader of the bullies at Springfield Elementary School (despite being one of the youngest), although he is often seen independently of the other bullies, and is Bart Simpson's former arch-enemy (later one of his best friends). He is a 6th grader." },
       { "name": "Dr. Nick Riveria", "phrase": "Hi, everybody!", "picture": "image14.jpg", "info": "Dr. Nicholas Riviera M.D. is a quack physician who studied at dubious medical schools, although he claims to be 'just as good as Dr. Hibbert M.D.'. He is inventor of Juice Loosener and Sun & Run. Dr. Nick faints in the Simpsons Movie but appears in several episodes after that and it was confirmed by Al Jean that he had not died like many first thought." },
       { "name": "Sideshow Bob", "phrase": "Hello, Bart.", "picture": "image15.jpg", "info": "Robert 'Bob' Underdunk Terwilliger, Jr., better known by his stage name, Sideshow Bob, which he got when he was Krusty the Clown's sidekick. Bob is a self-proclaimed genius, member of the Republican Party, champion of high culture, former children's entertainer-turned-criminal mastermind and Bart Simpson's nemesis. He loves Gilbert and Sullivan operettas and is known for his huge feet, which have gotten him into trouble on more than one occasion." },
       { "name": "Moe Szyslak", "phrase": "Ah, geez!", "picture": "image16.jpg", "info": "Moses 'Moe' Szyslak (pronounced 'siz-lack') or Momar 'Moe' Syzlak, also known as Moe the Bartender prior to Season 6, (born November 24) is the proprietor and bartender of 'Moe's Tavern', a Springfield bar frequented by Homer Simpson and his friends. He is of Polish descent, although himself states to come from a family of Dutch immigrants. He has once stated that he moved to Springfield from Holland. He also owns Moe's Bagels in Colorado. Moe is portrayed as often irritable and rude to all except his bar friends Homer, Lenny, and Carl, whom he sometimes treats as respected customers as opposed to his everyday drunks like Barney. His easy-to-lose harsh temper usually turns down women and finding a girlfriend for Moe has therefore been a running joke, from indulged sexual abstinence to unsuccessful suicide attempts to dating generally rejected women." },
       { "name": "Ralph Wiggum", "phrase": "When I grow up I wanna be a Pricipal Skinner", "picture": "image17.jpg", "info": "Ralph Wiggum is a student who attends Springfield Elementary School. He is best known as the town's resident oddball, and has been immortalized for his non sequiturs and erratic behavior. His lines range from purely nonsensical, or bizarre interpretations of a current event, to surprisingly profound statements that go over people's heads. For this, Ralph is somewhat of an outcast among his peers, although he seems to be on good terms with a fair number of the other kids at school, such as Bart and Lisa Simpson and Milhouse. The son of Police Chief Clancy and Sarah Wiggum, Ralph is a good-hearted and generally well-meaning boy who suffers from either severe learning and social disabilities, or some other form of childhood psychiatric disorder. The nature of his mentality is kept rather ambiguous, much like many of the signature traits of much of the show's cast. Like almost every other character in Springfield, he may not be quite as simple as he first seems, as evidenced by his hinted immense potential as a performer." },
       { "name": "Jasper Beardly", "phrase": "That's a Paddlin", "picture": "image18.jpg", "info": "Jasper is a World War II veteran. Jasper also tried to avoid the draft by disguising himself as a woman and staying in Springfield to play in the local women's baseball league, along with his friend Abe, who was also avoiding the war. He has been a substitute teacher who confiscated everything made of tin (according to Lisa) and got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener. He also preceded Reverend Lovejoy as minister at the Simpsons' church in Springfield. Jasper' father was a legal immigrant from Ireland and his mother was an illegal Mexican immigrant, who was deported when Jasper was 11." },
       { "name": "Patty Bouvier", "phrase": "Some days at the DMV, we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays.", "picture": "image19.jpg", "info": "Despite the similarities between her and Selma, Patty has been shown to be more jaded than her sister, particularly towards relationships. Marge once said that Patty chose a life of celibacy, but Selma had it thrust upon her. Patty's decision to not have relationships has been implied to be due to her then-closeted sexuality. When her Aunt Gladys dies, Gladys records in her video will advice to Patty and Selma to get married and have a family. Selma takes this to heart, while Patty seems to pay no attention, remarking that they did well with Gladys leaving them her grandfather clock. She is more vicious to Homer than Selma is, and unlike Selma, who experiences brief moments of kindness to Homer, Patty has no pity for Homer's well-being." },
       { "name": "Selma Bouvier", "phrase": "How's my blubber in-law?!", "picture": "image20.jpg", "info": "Selma Bouvier was born two minutes before Patty. Due to a childhood bottle rocket accident, she lost the sense of taste and smell. Selma's favorite film actor was reportedly Troy McClure, to whom she was briefly married, before discovering that it was just a publicity stunt by McClure. McClure took it one step further by wanting to have a child with Selma to help his career. Selma was willing to live a sham for a while, but broke it off when she realized she couldn't bring a child into a loveless marriage. According to Marge, Selma is 'the one who likes Police Academy movies and Hummel figurines, and walking through the park on clear autumn days.' Selma inherited her deceased Aunt Gladys's iguana, Jub-Jub, instead of her mother, Jacqueline, due to Jacqueline's dislike of Jub-Jub. Unlike Patty, Selma is very desperate to find love after seeing her Aunt Gladys' video will. She also asks Marge for advice to find love, saying that Patty is 2 minutes younger than she is." },
       { "name": "Kent Brockman", "phrase": "Well, touché.", "picture": "image21.jpg", "info": "Kent Brockman represents the worst of his profession: frequently judgmental; careerist to the point of absurdity; and more than willing to film and sensationalize a schmaltzy, emotion driven puff piece for the sake of a few extra ratings points. He has been seen throwing tantrums because he cannot find certain snack foods, and once blithely announced on-the-air that the boom operator on his news program was being fired the next morning. He seems to command excessive levels of power within Channel 6, even having a segment of the news program to air his own opinions on current issues called My Two Cents. His comments and views on people with mental illness has also not gone down well, saying in online sports forums that he is on his’ two tablets a day and doing fine’ Which was meant as a put down to people with such conditions. Despite all of this, he has won a string a media awards, but is most proud of his unspecified trophy from Del Monte." },
       { "name": "Bumblebee Man", "phrase": "Ay, ay, ay! No es bueno!", "picture": "image22.jpg", "info": "Yaritza Burgos, or Bumblebee Man, is the star of a Spanish-language television sitcom on 'Channel Ocho', in which he dresses in a bumblebee costume and performs slapstick comedy." },

He is the owner and manager of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Burns is Springfield's richest and most powerful citizen. His net worth has been stated to be in the billions and in one instance was pegged at exactly $1,800,037,022. Yet he once lost his entire fortune and at another time slipped to 'only' $996 million, leading to his expulsion from Billionaire Camp. Burns is very elderly and physically frail; regardless, he employs his evil, cruel, bitter, cynical, heartless and greedy tactics to get what he wants." },
       { "name": "Carl Carlson", "phrase": "See, statements like that are why people think we're gay.", "picture": "image24.jpg", "info": "C. Carlton 'Carl' Carlson , Jr or 'the black one' (as referred to by Homer Simpson as a simpler way of remembering who he is) is a safety operations supervisor from the sector 7G of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, where he works alongside his childhood friends Lenny and Homer. Carl is a self-restrained organized (although not maniac about it, like was Frank Grimes) employee and likes to call himself 'an urban Lenny'. It was in fact hinted to in the series that him and Lenny could actually be more than just friends. Carl also attended Springfield A&M University. Mr Burns once implied that he was a war hero." },

       { "name": "Eddie", "phrase": " Hmm... Must've sprung up over night.", "picture": "image26.jpg", "info": "Eddie is one of the two police officers who aid Chief Wiggum on almost every mission. Unlike Lou, he is rather unintelligent, but still not as dumb as Wiggum." },

He is under the command of Commissioner Clancy Wiggum, and often takes the time to point out Wiggum's mistakes (often while a crime—or the pursuit of a criminal—is still in progress)." },
       { "name": "Fat Tony", "phrase": " What's a murder?", "picture": "image28.jpg", "info": "Marion Anthony D'Amico, also known as William Williams or, more commonly, 'Fat Tony', was the boss of the D'Amico crime family. He has been behind several of Springfield's criminal enterprises. His rackets included illegal gambling, cigarette smuggling, and bootlegging. He had also been seen bribing and making secret deals with Mayor Quimby." },
       { "name": "Maude Flanders", "phrase": "I don't judge Homer or Marge. That's for a vengeful God to do.", "picture": "image29.jpg", "info": "Maude Flanders was the wife of Ned Flanders, and the mother of Rod and Todd. Maude was a woman with many positive qualities: faith, kindness, and charity. She loved to draw, which was found out after her death. She had a thick Midwestern (Minnesotan) accent. Maude Flanders was a devout Christian who once attended a Bible camp to learn how to be more judgmental. She campaigned strongly against Itchy and Scratchy with Marge. She is often partnered with Helen Lovejoy as they protest against the 'evils' in Springfield. Maude died by falling off a grandstand, after being hit with several shirts from a t-shirt cannon at the Springfield Speedway. Homer used to have a crush on her." },
       { "name": "Rod Flanders", "phrase": "Hooray!", "picture": "image30.jpg", "info": "Rod often prays, first thing in the morning and last thing before going to bed. He prays for God to watch over him and his little brother, Todd. He prays for the success of his father's business. He also prays for the success of all Christians, but due to his upbringing does not respect people of other (or no) faiths. Aside from praying, Rod enjoys playing with Todd and eating lots of 'Nachos, Flanders-Style' (cucumbers with cottage cheese). His one regret is that he can't pray at school." },
       { "name": "Todd Flanders", "phrase": "Lies make baby Jesus cry.", "picture": "image31.jpg", "info": "Todd Flanders is Ned's 9-year-old son. He is the most impressionable and youngest member of the Flanders family. When exposed to profanity, Todd himself starts to curse. An example would be after Todd heard Homer cursing, he had said 'Hell, no' and 'I said I don't want any damn vegetables' at the dinner table. When Moe Szyslak loses his temper at Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag restaurant, Todd responds with 'Ow, my freaking ears!'. Whether due to immaturity or relentless sheltering by his parents, whenever Todd comes into contact with anything outside his family and their pious ways, such as the time he and Rod were tricked into eating a Pixy Stix by Bart Simpson, he turns nasty, telling his older brother to 'go to hell zitface', much to the delight of Bart. He typically dresses in shorts and on some occasions wears a floppy 'newsboy' cap." },

He dresses in military fatigues. He is an insectivorian. Herman has only one arm. He told Bart that the other arm was lost by sticking it out of the window of a moving bus and it was torn off by a truck in the other direction. It was also implied it was him, as Ms. Krabappel said not to do it because a kid once lost an arm that way, while on a bus. However, in To Cur, with Love, it was revealed that he stuck it out on a street while trying to hail a car, resulting in the arm being torn off by a passing dogcatcher truck driven by Chief Wiggum." },

His biggest competitors are the NFL, warm beds on a Sunday morning, and cable. He describes how he initially came to Springfield an eager, idealistic young man in the seventies, only to become cynical and disillusioned about his flock and ministry, mostly due to Ned Flanders, who constantly pesters him with such non-emergencies as coveting his own wife. Lovejoy would dispatch such concerns with maximum brevity so that he could return to playing with his model trains (his true passion), and in one case, his dessert.

He struggles to control the crumbling school and is constantly engaged in a battle against its inadequate resources, apathetic and bitter teachers, and often rowdy and unenthusiastic students, Bart Simpson being a standout example. A strict disciplinarian, Skinner has an uptight, militaristic attitude that stems from his years in the United States Army as a Green Beret, which included service in the Vietnam War, where he achieved the rank of a sergeant, according to his rank insignia. As a result of his service in the Vietnam War, he is often plagued by horrible memories of his involvement via post traumatic stress disorder, sometimes even happening at the most inopportune of times. It's also implied that he received a severe enough injury during the Vietnam War on his posterior to require a metal plate to be installed in it." },

Wiggum claims to have compromising photographs of the mayor. Mayor Quimby argued back saying, 'you don't scare me; that could be anyone's ass'!
